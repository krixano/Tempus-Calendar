# Tempus-Calendar

**Tempus Calendar** is an efficient calendar program for Windows. Linux and macOS support coming later.

It supports 3 main calendars (Gregorian, Julian, and Jewish), with more (e.g. Hijri) coming soon.

Tempus Calendar will also calculate sunrise, sunset, dawn, and dusk times based on a given location. This is all done locally - no internet connection is made. Simply put in your longitude and latitude, and the program will do all the calculations itself.

Finally, it will calculate Jewish Zmanim, Islamic Salah, and Christian prayer times.

The project is still in heavy development, and therefore in an alpha state, but it is functional enough to be useful.

You can buy the software, along with all future updates, [here at itch.io](https://krixano.itch.io/tempus-calendar).

## How to Use
